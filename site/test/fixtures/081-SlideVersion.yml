The great names of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Uhura are iconic in the mythology of ''Star Trek''. </p>\n\nThey were the first to go where no man had gone before when Gene Roddenberry launched his series in the 1960s. Abrams 2009 film not only relaunches the franchise, but pays particular homage to forty plus years of show history and the characters that are legends in their own right."

Shatner''s larger than life portrayal is hard to match, but Pine delivers a rougher, cruder version of the polished Kirk.
