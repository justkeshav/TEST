    text: "<p>[[Image: half ponytail.JPG|300px|thumb|adright|Half tails work well for girls.|[Easy Pony Tail Styles]]]</p>\n\nA look thatâ€™s easy, casual and just a little bit elegant, a half ponytail is a fun style that solves the problem when youâ€™re really torn about whether to wear your hair up or down. \n\n<h2>Half the Style, Twice as Popular</h2>\n\n<p>So versatile itâ€™s even seen at the Academy Awards, this is the basis for the fabulous [[Half Updos | half updo]] -- and itâ€™s ridiculously simple. All you need to do is pull back the hair on either side of the face, thus creating a [[Ponytails | ponytail]] that sits either just above or right at the crown of the head. You can secure it with an elastic band, a decorative clip, or a barrette. What you do with the rest of the hair is up to you, but if youâ€™re just trying to look decent before dashing out the door, you only need to brush it all through and youâ€™re done. </p>\n\n<h2>Dressing Up Your Half Ponytail</h2>\n\n<p>While itâ€™s a great choice for when you want to keep your hair free flowing but also keep it out of your face, the half tail can also be turned into all kinds of hair styles, from the adorable to the elegant, depending on your mood and the occasion. </p>\n\n<h3>Romantic Half Tail</h3>\n<p>If you want an old-fashioned, romantic look, add different [[Braid Designs| braid designs]] to the ponytail and bind it with a flower decoration. You can also use a jeweled stick to pierce the braid, giving it an even more medieval style. This looks best against very straight, smooth, shiny hair, although if you have longer hair, the braid will lie nicely against soft waves or curls. </p>\n\nLikewise, you can also curl the ponytail and add matching curls to the base of your hair. You might even consider curling your bangs, if you wear them. You will be very bouncy. \n\n<h3>Half-up Elegant Braided Ponytail</h3>\n<p>You can also divide the ponytail into a number of small braids. Again, this adds simple elegance and a dash of pizzazz. Or, you can create slim braids from the sides of the head that will then be integrated into the ponytail. These do not have to be [[French Braids| French braids]], although you can certainly do that as well. Just a few braids lying against the head before being drawn back, especially if your hair is long, will have a very Renaissance look about it. </p>\n\n<h3>Half-Up Knot</h3>\n<p>Thereâ€™s also nothing to say that the ponytail has to stay hanging. If youâ€™re going out in the evening and want to change your look, twist part of it into a knot and add a decorative barrette. </p>\n\n<h2>The Rest of Your 'Do</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, a half ponytail, especially when integrated into an elegant style, is just the first step in creating some sort of [[Updo Styles | updo style]] suitable for weddings, [[Prom Hair Updos| proms]], or any big event when you want your hair to look special. Once youâ€™ve got part of your hair up and secured, you can start playing with the possibilities, usually involving curling or waving the free flowing hair and integrating it into the updo, using loops or knots and securing it further with decorative clips. </p>\n\n<h2>Fun with Ties</h2>\n[[image:scrunchies.jpg|right|frame|Secure with colorful ties.]]\nEven for an ordinary day, thereâ€™s no reason you canâ€™t liven up your look with decoration. Besides the aforementioned barrettes, clips and flowers, you can tie scarves around your hair, either binding them in a bow or letting them hang in a slightly 1950s style. Or, you can wear the scarf or a bright headband nearer the top of your head and bind the ponytail a bit more loosely, securing it with a larger clip. This will give you a look more reminiscent of the early 1960s. \n\n<p>Slim ribbons or any other fun ties â€“ even funky shoelaces â€“ can be integrated into your hair, making a simple look that much more fun. You can wear a half ponytail every day of the week and never look the same. </p>\n\n----\nQuick, easy, and versatile, a half ponytail style is great for all ages. With many ways to dress up this [[Everyday Hairdos | everyday hairdo]], you truly can wear it every day and never have a dull look.\n\n<p>[[Category: Hair Styles]]</p>"

Never a ratings winner, it was slated to be cancelled after two years. A write-in campaign by fans saved the show for another year, the first time in recorded history that this has happened. (This was unfortunate in a way because it provided a precedent that fans of other shows always use to justify an uphill, usually fruitless, battle to save a doomed show. \"Hey, fans brought back Star Trek, you know.\" Never mind that the third season of Star Trek is widely considered to be the weakest, productive of some of the gawd-awfullest Trek-moments ever aired.)\n\n<p>In those days, when a show was gone, it was gone. Back then, a second life in syndication or movies was unheard of. You could make the case that the  Trek franchise invented the second life in movies, the spin-offs, in fact, invented the entire concept of the 'franchise'.</p>\n\n<h3>Star Trek in the Movies</h3>\n\n<p>After a decade of life in syndication, Star Trek re-emerged in the movie theaters with the release of The Motion Picture. After four 'original series' movies had appeared to reasonable success, the franchise returned to the small screen with [[Star Trek: The Next Generation]], which was much more successful, both financially and dramatically, than the original series ever was, running for seven years, and then graduating to feature films like its predecessor.</p>\n\nNow the Star Trek franchise encompasses six [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|television series]], ten motion pictures, and [[Star Trek Characters|novels]] uncountable. \n\n<p>Not bad for a series that barely made it to three seasons and never had that many viewers.</p>"

    text: "<p>[[image:Beverlycrusher.gif|adright]]</p>\n\nWhen ''Star Trek'' the original series had been off the air for a few years, it was easy to look back and mock the roles women played in a Star Fleet hundreds of years in the future - bringing the Captain's coffee and connecting his calls. This risible residue of the sixties must have been in the minds of the production team when ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' as planned.\n\n<p>\"Look\", they might say, \"we have a woman ''doctor''. Oh, and a female counsellor... uh, wait a minute... both 'caring professions'... I know, let's throw in a tough-as-nails female security officer!\" And that's what they did, although the obligatory 'female in a male job' was eaten by a sentient oil slick early in the series' run.</p>\n\n<h2>Enter Dr. Crusher</h2>\n\n<p>Beverly Crusher, the Enterprise-D's Chief Medical Officer, has a History. Married to Jack Crusher, Captain Picard's closest friend, who died under his command, she is mother to [[Wesley Crusher]], Picard's young acolyte. She also bears a torch for Picard that flies almost, but not quite, under his radar.</p>\n\n[[image:Mcfadden.jpg|left]]\n\n<p>Played by Gates McFadden, Dr. Crusher is a caring yet no-nonsense medical professional. She's also feminine and strong, and has had a number of relationships during her tenure in Star Fleet, notably with a trill symbiot who, in the course of their romance, is forced to switch hosts, leaving its male host for a female one. (Dr. Crusher found herself unattracted to the being she loved when in female form and the relationship ended, albeit with good feelings on both sides.)</p>\n\n<h2>Crusher and Picard</h2>\n\n<p>It's unclear if Picard's feelings for Crusher are kept sublimated by the fact that she is his best friend's widow, that she's within his chain of command, or perhaps he just doesn't 'think about her that way'. </p>\n\nIn an alternate timeline created by the trouble-making [[Q]], Crusher and Picard have been married and divorced, with Beverly moving on to command a medical ship. In a quaint bit of Twentieth Century sensibility, she apparently took his surname when they married, so that fun could be had with the two of them both answering to the query \"Captain Picard?\"\n\n<h2>Crusher and Wesley</h2>\n\n<p>As mom to the wunderkind Wesley, Beverly has her biggest challenge, but their relationship remained strong throughout the angsty-years. A scientist herself, she must have nurtured his scientific aspirations, and is rarely at a loss, except for the one 'warp bubble' experiment of Wesley's that runs amok, trapping her in another, shrinking universe from which her son must rescue her. I don't believe he was even grounded for the faux pas, however.</p>\n\n<h2>Interregnum</h2>\n\n<p>Dr. Crusher was briefly replaced as CMO on the Enterprise by the crusty and irritable Dr. Pulaski, loathed by fans for treating Data as a thing, and mispronouncing his name. Dr. Pulaski served throughout season two, and Dr. Crusher returned (from where? doing what?) in season three and remained throughout the rest of the series and into the ST:NG movies.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Articles</h2>\n\n*[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]\n*[[Captain Jean Luc Picard]]\n*[[Wesley Crusher]]\n*[[Counsellor Deanna Troi]]\n*[[Guinan]]\n\n<p>[[Category:Star Trek]]</p>"

Magic happens here, and races other than human share the land, dwarves, elves, and particularly [[Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring|the little hobbits]].\n\n<p>J. R. R. Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings'' was strongly influenced by the Celtic and Anglo-Saxon mythos that he taught at Oxford University; the saga that he began with a children's book contains echoes of ''Beowulf'', Norse mythology and classics such as Homer. Yet the overall ambiance, at least of the Shire of the hobbits, was of a bucolic England before the [[Lord of the Rings Swords|Great War]] (that's World War I), with its rigid class structure and orderly countryside.</p>\n\nMonsters exist in Tolkien's world, and heroes. Wizards travel with common adventurers, centuries-old elves ally with short-lived men. But the success or failure of the quest to save the world from being enslaved by evil incarnate falls on the smallest, the most insignificant (in the worldly scheme of things), the untravelled, stay-at-home hobbit.\n\n<p>Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy was the beginning of many things. For one, it was the beginning of the now-almost-ironclad rule that fantasy must be packaged in trilogies - not a universally positive development. But ''The Lord of the Rings'', called LotR by fans, was the beginning of a collasal boom in fantasy literature that continues to this day. </p>\n\nNow, decades after their publication, movie technology has improved to the point where such a saga can be filmed without doing serious damage to the source, and Peter Jackson's trilogy of ''Lord of the Rings'' movies, brought a whole new generation of fans to this landmark work of fiction. \n\n<p>This category celebrates J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' in all its forms.</p>"

    text: "<p>[[image:Returnofthekingcover.gif|200px|adright]]</p>\n\n<h2>The Return of the King - Quest's End</h2>\n\n<p>All heroic journeys ultimately end in heroes being rewarded (rarely does the hero lose, except in Greek tragedy), and ''Lord of the Rings'' is no exception. Of course, there's a whole volume full of struggle to get through to reach the winner's circle.</p>\n\n<h2>Scattered Fellowship</h2>\n\n<p>In ''The Return of the King'', the original Fellowship of the Ring is scattered throughout MiddleEarth, all converging on the last battle with Dark Lord Sauron. Hobbit Pippin is with wizard Gandalf as they reach Minas Tirith, the capital city of Gondor, which leads the war against Mordor. Hobbit Merry is with the Rohirrim as they prepare to ride to Gondor to the aid of their ancient allies. Aragorn, the human heir to the throne of Gondor, which has sat vacant for generations, with elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli, ride a secret path through the lands of the dead, mustering deceased warriors to their cause. And Frodo and Sam edge ever closer to their objective, in the heart of the enemy's country.</p>\n\n<h2>Thwarted Ambition, Thwarted Love</h2>\n\n<p>The third volume of the ''Lord of the Rings'' offers two instances of the adage 'you can't always get what you want'. Not every hero wins their heart's desire. </p>\n\nIn Gondor, the throne has been unoccupied since Isildur rode away to his death, generations ago. The country has been ruled by Stewards, a heriditary title that passes from father to son. Yet the current Steward, Denathor, father of Boromir who betrayed the Fellowship in Book I, no longer considers himself the King's Steward, but ruler in his own right. Knowledge that an heir to Isildur is returning to claim the vacant throne drives him mad, and he dies by his own hand, while trying to slay his surviving son.\n\n<p>In Rohan, the King's daughter Eowyn finds herself enamoured of the returning king, Aragorn. Yet unbeknownst to her (or the reader), Aragorn has already pledged himself to Arwen, Elrond's daughter, a half-elven lady as far above him in station as he is above Eowyn. In despair at his kind rejection, Eowyn disguises herself as a man to ride with her father's army, in search of an honorable death on the field of battle. Of course, she doesn't find it, and it is her battle with the Nazgul king that helps turn the tide against the armies of Mordor. She later finds a less lofty love in the person of Denathor's surviving son Faramir. This 'be happy with your station in life' motif is characteristic of fiction written in the period. Fantasy literature has only recently broken free of the rigid caste system of the feudal period in which much fantasy is set, to allow butchers boys and pickpockets to ascend to heroic roles.</p>\n\nAragorn's crowning as king of Gondor is, of course, ''The Return of the King''.\n\n<h2>An Awkward Coda</h2>\n\n<p>Having seen the quest through to its end, destroying the Ring and watching the installation of their friend Aragorn as King of Gondor, the hobbits return to their buccolic life in the Shire, only to find the Shire has been turned into a communistic collective and they must reassert the power of the status quo to their own land.</p>\n\nAfter a period of years, Frodo finds himself unable to settle into Shire life and leaves on an elven ship from the Grey Havens to the land in the west to which the elves are fleeing; it is a land from which there is no return. The analogy is clear, if unstated. \n\n<h2>Related Articles</h2>\n\n*[[Tolkien's The Hobbit]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]\n*[[Tolkien's Women: Arwen and Eowyn]]\n\n<p>[[Category:The Lord of the Rings]]</p>"

    text: "<p>The Lord of the Rings' swords are some of the most famous fictional swords today.</p>\n\n<h2>Real Swords Have Names</h2>\n\n<p>Since days of old, important warriors bore important weapons; these weapons were unique to them, often forged under mysterious or magical circumstances, or came to the bearer in unusual, often magical ways. Even before Arthur plucked Excalibur from the hand of the Lady of the Lake, these weapons have been almost characters in their own right, with names, histories and legends associated with them. ''The Lord of the Rings'' mythos is no exception.</p>\n\n<h2>The Swords of the Troll Hoard</h2>\n\n<p>Several important swords were discovered by heroes in ''The Hobbit'', the briefer 'prequel' to ''The Lord of the Rings''. </p>\n\nEarly on in Bilbo's adventure traveling with the twelve dwarves and the Wizard Gandalf, they run afoul of a trio of trolls, who pop all the dwarves in bags. They spend some time debating the best way to prepare dwarf for trollish consumption - sitting on them to squash them to jelly, mincing them fine and boiling them, and so on. Just when it appears they have agreed on a method, one of them seems to reopen the debate, and the argument begins again. \n\n<p>In reality, Gandalf, who had left the party and fortuitously returned, was immitating their voices to keep them occupied so they would not notice the approach of dawn, for trolls, 'as everyone knows', have to be underground during the daylight hours, since light turns them to stone.</p>\n\nThe freed dwarves, Bilbo and Gandalf locate and search the trolls' den, and find three impressive blades, ''Glamdring'', ''Orcrist'' and ''Sting''. Gandalf appropriates ''Glamdring'' to be his own sword, and the leader of the dwarves, Thorin Oakenshield, takes ''Orcrist'' to be his own. ''Orcrist'' was laid on Thorin's tomb after the Battle of Five Armies and warns the defenders of the Lonely Mountain of pending attacks.\n\n<h2>Sting</h2>\n\n<p>Bilbo selected one of the troll-hoard weapons himself. This was actually a long knife, but was proportionally 'sword-length' for a hobbit. It, along with Gandalf's and Thorin's swords, was made by the Elves of Gondolin before the Fall, although how these weapons ever survived and came to Middle Earth is unknown. Because the swords, including Bilbo's knife, were meant to battle Orcs, they were forged so that they glowed with a faint blue light whenever Orcs were near. </p>\n\nBilbo used his sword against the giant spiders of the Misty Mountains, and so effective was it that he named it ''Sting''. It is this sword that he passes down to Frodo when his nephew accepts the role of Ring Bearer at the Council of Elrond in the first volume of ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\n<h2>Narsil and Anduril</h2>\n\n<p>''Narsil'' was already an ancient sword when it was first deployed against Sauron before the events of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Elendil, the founder of the kingdom of Gondor, was its bearer, and when he fell, ''Narsil'' broke beneath him. His son Isildur took the broken shards, and cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand, temporarily defeating him and causing him to flee from his body. The shards of ''Narsil'' became heirlooms of the House of Isildur, even in exile, and were handed down to Aragorn as he attained his adult years.</p>\n\nWhen the One Ring is revealed, ''Narsil'' is reforged by elven smiths and renamed ''Anduril'', which Aragorn takes into battle against Sauron again. \n\n<p>''Narsil'' means 'firelight' and ''Anduril'' means 'Flame of the West'.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Lord of the Rings Articles</h2>\n\n*[[Tolkien's The Hobbit]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]\n\n<p>[[Category:The Lord of the Rings]]</p>"

    text: "<p>[[image:Fellowshipcover.jpg|200px|adright]]</p>\n\n<h2>Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring -- A Quest Begins</h2>\n\n<p>When we left the Shire at the end of The Hobbit (and few readers come to the Lord of the Rings not having read its children's book predecessor), Bilbo had returned from his adventure with a broader outlook, and a renewed appreciation for the settled life of his home. </p>\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring begins some fifty years later, with an elderly Bilbo contemplating one last adventure, and planning to give up his home and fortune - enhanced by dragon-gold - to his nephew and heir Frodo. \n\n<p>Tolkien cleverly uses the construct of Bilbo's 'eleventy-first' birthday party bash to transition the tone, from the avucular jokey one he used in The Hobbit, to one more appropriate for the telling of an Epic High Fantasy Quest. After Bilbo's party, with a few departures into some gentle comic relief, usually provided by the Gamgees, the epic's general flavor becomes high-flown and suitably solemn. \"Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow takes another shape and grows again.\" </p>\n\nGood versus Evil. Heavy stuff.\n\n<h2>A Company is Formed</h2>\n\n<p>In Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring, we learn, as hero Frodo learns, that the ring that Bilbo brought back from his adventures isn't a simple party trick or handy gadget, but is a powerful and dangerous talisman. The Ring, in fact, the One Ring to Rule Them All that the evil Dark Lord made years ago and into which he has poured much of his power. </p>\n\nNow, the Dark Lord is looking for his Ring again, to reclaim his strength and cement his rule. Total subjugation of all the free races that inhabit MiddleEarth is his goal, and only destruction of the Ring will stop him.\n\n<p>Coming together at Rivendell, our hobbit hero and his friends meet with representatives from many of the world's free races, to discuss and decide on the fate of the Ring. </p>\n\n<h2>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship</h2>\n\n<p>With Frodo are his three friends, Merry and Pippin, cousins of a sort, and Sam, son of his gardener and essentially Frodo's servant and valet. Sam's role harks back to a time in which master and servant had well-defined spheres and in which servants absorbed the status and values of their masters, rejoicing in their successes and commiserating at their failures. Sam's relationship with Frodo is one of the mainsprings of the story.</p>\n\nAlso joining the company are two men, Boromir, from the human kingdom of Gondor, son and heir of the Steward of the Kingdom and Aragorn, met first as an anonymous 'ranger', who claims to be the heir to the throne of Gondor. \n\n<p>Representing the dwarves, Gimli comes from the mountain kingdom, and for the elves, Legolas joins the company; with Gandalf the wizard, the nine represent the free races in opposition to the Dark Lord Sauron of Mordor.</p>\n\n<h2>Targetting the Lion's Lair</h2>\n\n<p>The Fellowship is resolved, to take the Ring into Mordor itself, the home of the Dark Lord, and to destroy the Ring in the firy mountain where it was first forged, the only fire hot enough to destroy it.</p>\n\nAgainst them are arrayed all the spies, sneaks, ghouls, orcs and other bad things that call the Dark Lord their ruler. Gandalf is lost to an enemy in the Misty Mountains, and treachery reaches into the hearts of the company itself, as Boromir tries to steal the Ring from Frodo, forcing Frodo and Sam to flee alone, and the rest of the Company to follow. Readers of Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring must continue to next book in the trilogy: The Two Towers. \n\n<h2>Related Lord of the Rings Articles</h2>\n\n*[[Tolkien's The Hobbit]]\n*[[The Peter Jackson Movies]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]\n*[[Tolkien's Women: Arwen and Eowyn]]\n\n<p>[[Category: The Lord of the Rings]]</p>"

    text: "<p>[[image:Twotowerscover.jpg|200px|adright]]</p>\n\n<h2>The Dreaded Middle Book Syndrome</h2>\n\n<p>''The Lord of the Rings'' is basically a very lengthy sage that has been helpfully broken down into three volumes for ease of reading. Each volume has a unique name, but they are definitely not stand-alone books.</p>\n\nWhile the first volume very much has a beginning, as the point-of-view character Frodo finds out about the ring he inherited, and the third volume very much has an ending, with a climatic battle, good versus evil and the clash of civilizations, the second volume starts in the middle of the story and ends very much in the middle of the story.\n\n<p>Don't pick this book up without having read ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' first.</p>\n\n<h2>The Eponymous Two Towers</h2>\n\n<p>''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' of the title refer to Orcthanc and Minas Morgul, although a case could be made for any number of other important towers that play roles here. </p>\n\nThe book starts at an awkward spot - the Fellowship for which the first book was named has just been forcibly broken up. Frodo and Sam have left the band, frightened at the influence the Ring they carry is having on their fellows, and resolved to complete the quest alone. Boromir has been killed attempting to save the two younger hobbits, Merry and Pippin, from evil Orcs. He has failed and the remainder of the fellowship, knowing that Frodo and Sam at least are at liberty and chose their path, follow the path of the marauders to try to rescue the prisoner hobbits.\n\n<p>For fully half the book, the story follows these characters, leaving the fate of Frodo and Sam to the second half of the book. This is strange storytelling to a modern reader, who is more used to the (apparently relatively new) technique of interleaving chapters that switch from one sphere of action to another and back again, keeping us apprised of what is happening to various groups of characters alternatively. One is forced to speculate that The Two Towers might not be quite so draggy in spots if Tolkien had employed this device.</p>\n\n<h2>Monsters, Spiders and Talking Trees</h2>\n\n<p>In ''Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'', we discover that Gandalf, thought killed in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', has survived, but that a fellow wizard, Saruman, is a traitor. The hobbits are saved from Saruman's minion orcs by the Ents, eldest tree spirits that take the form of walking, talking giant trees. Our reduced fellowship, the dwarf, elf, man and wizard, enlist the help of the rider of Rohan, a rather primitive, by Gondorian standards, society that lives on the plains protected by Gondor. </p>\n\nTurning our attention to the two hobbits who fled the fellowship, we find Frodo and Sam making their way toward the enemy's land. They meet up with the sad, strange creature Gollum, from whom Bilbo had found the ring many years ago, and are forced to enlist his treacherous self into their company to further their own goals and prevent him from giving them away. Alas, for good intentions, Gollum leads the two directly to the lair of Shelob, a giant spider, who stings Frodo with a poisonous bite, allowing him to be captured by orcs. It is at this inauspicious moment that the second volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' ends.\n\n<p>Just try to quit reading here!</p>\n\n<h2>Related Lord of the Rings Articles</h2>\n\n*[[Tolkien's The Hobbit]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]\n*[[Tolkien's Women: Arwen and Eowyn]]\n\n<p>[[Category:The Lord of the Rings]]</p>"

    text: "<p>[[image:Hobbitcover.jpg|200px|adright]]</p>\n\n<h2>Tolkien's The Hobbit: The Beginning of a Saga</h2>\n\n<p>J. R. R. Tolkien's, The Hobbit, is perhaps unique in literature. It is a book specifically written for young children, and it is the 'prequel' to a much larger, darker work written for adults, the three-volume Lord of the Rings. It is easy to suspect that it was planned that way, that The Hobbit was meant to develop an audience that would be grown up when the larger, denser work was ready for their consumption. It is easy to suspect, perhaps, but you would be wrong. </p>\n\nTolkien's plans with respect to the MiddleEarth universe he created in both the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings weren't so easy to codify. He wrote both forwards and backwards on his timeline, employing tones and techniques suited to a variety of different audiences, from the children who would enjoy a fairy tale, to scholars who might be interested in the development of a fictional language.\n\n<h2>In a Hole in the Ground</h2>\n\n<p>Tolkien's The Hobbit was published in 1937, but was begun much earlier, with one sentence written on the back of a paper. \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\" At the time, Tolkien had only the vaguest of ideas what a hobbit even was. But soon, as we readers discovered, he clarified that hobbits weren't den beasts that dug out burrows to house their litters, but little people who built their homes underground. These homes were as cozy as an English country cottage, and very similar in furnishing and details, all lavishly described.</p>\n\nOur hero is one Bilbo Baggins. He is a hobbit of means; at least, no occupation is ever specified, so we are left with the impression of a 'gentlehobbit' that need not work for a living. He is surprised one day to be visited by a wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves. For reasons never sufficiently explained, Gandalf has decided that Bilbo is just the one they need to become their band's 'burglar', and without understanding how it happens, Bilbo finds himself swept up in their adventure, on his way to a place over the mountains to slay a dragon and reclaim an ancient dwarven hoard of treasure.\n\n<h2>The Road Goes Ever On</h2>\n\n<p>Hitherto very much an observer of life, pottering about his house and reading books to satisfy his longing for adventure, Bilbo discovers that real-life (well, fantasy-life) adventure is often uncomfortable and even scary. The dwarves run afoul of goblins, are captured by elves, meet a shapeshifter in the wild woods, and in general have a lively time in their attempts to reach the mountains of their ancestors. </p>\n\nThroughout, Bilbo discovers what he's made of, and it's sterner stuff than what he had previously any inkling. The dwarves come to respect him as a clever companion and useful friend. Along the way, Bilbo serendipitiously acquires a magic golden ring that can make the wearer invisible. A truly useful tool for a budding burglar, indeed.\n\n<p>It is this magical artifact that forms the basis for the quest saga, the Lord of the Rings.</p>\n\n<h2>A Children's Intro to MiddleEarth</h2>\n\n<p>Tolkien's The Hobbit is definitely a children's book, not a 'prequel' for mature readers. The tone is often jokey, even slightly condescending. The story is a straight-forward journey, and although the main character achieves growth and change, there isn't anything in the way of shades of grey or complexity to entrance an older reader. </p>\n\n<h2>Related Fantasy Articles</h2>\n\n*[[Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]\n*[[Lord of the Rings Swords]]\n\n<p>[[Category:The Lord of the Rings]]</p>"

    text: "[[image:camera1.jpg|adright|frame|]]\nHair style pictures can be a great tool for anyone interested in a new [[Hair Styles | style]] but who is unsure of exactly what they are looking for. Experienced stylists can recreate even elaborate dos from different photographs, or they can combine several looks into one new style perfect for your face shape, hair characteristics, and lifestyle.\n\n<h2>Finding Hair Style Pictures</h2>\n<p>There are several places to find suitable pictures of hair styles, including:</p>\n\n*Online Style Galleries: Either real or virtual pictures.\n*[[Hair Style Magazines]]: General and ethnic magazines are available.\n*Regular Magazines: Any picture of a great hair style â€“ even from an advertisement â€“ can be used.\n*Photos of Friends and Family: Always get permission to show their picture to your stylist.\n*Hair Style Books: Usually available in [[Beauty Salons | salons]].\n*Bridal, Prom, and Specialty Magazines: Many specialty publications feature hair style galleries.\n\n<p>Not every picture is useable, however. If you print photographs from a website or digital camera, be sure that your printer can produce a high-quality image with sufficient detail for the stylist to determine if there are [[Hair Highlights | highlights]], [[Layered Hair Styles | layers]], or other intricate features to the do. Photos should be large enough to show those details clearly, and using several photos from different angles can help the stylist emulate the cut properly. Very dark photos are typically not usable, nor are any blurry or partially obscured photos.</p>\n\n<h2>Choosing a Style from Pictures</h2>\n<p>You may examine hundreds of hair style pictures before finding the perfect look, but it is important to remember that no matter how great it is in the picture, it wonâ€™t look the same on you (unless, of course, itâ€™s your picture!). While you can get general ideas and inspiration from photographs, be sure to take your stylistâ€™s recommendations into consideration before deciding on a new look: different face shapes, skin tones, and hair textures all affect the final look of a hair style. The best tactic is to select several hair style pictures of similar looks and discuss which aspects of each you like the most so your stylist can combine them into a stunning style just for you.</p>"

Collectively they are known as the Q Continuum, and when we meet others of the species, they are also called 'Q'. In fact, we only have his word for it that the one who interacts with the people of Star Fleet is in fact the same entity, or indeed if individuals even exist as such in the Continuum.</p>\n\n[[image:SquireGothos.jpg|left]]\nThere is some speculation in fandom that the 'Squire of Gothos' who childlishly toyed with the crew of the original Enterprise was a child of the Continuum.\n\n<p>Q appears several times throughout the run of ST:NG, visits [[Star Trek: Voyager]] in the Delta Quadrant, and even <i>Deep Space Nine</i>. But it is always Picard he appears to love to torment the most.</p>\n\nHis most dangerous 'trick' is when he tosses the Enterprise into the Delta Quadrant, where they meet the implacable Borg for the first time.\n\n<h2>The Guru</h2>\n\n<p>Q is played by actor John deLancie, who gives the character an arrogance that would be charming if it wasn't so annoying. He is effete, pompous, infuriatingly know-it-all, and a welcome addition to any Star Trek plotline. </p>\n\nHe is particularly enjoyable when, for whatever reason, he loses his omnipotence, as in the episode <i>Deja Q</i>, when he has been sentenced to be human by the rest of his race. While the crew races to try to help a planet whose moon has such an erratic orbit that it is calculated to make such a close pass that it will destroy all life, he deals with the fact that he can't do anything to help. \n\n<p>\"It's simple,\" he insists to Engineer Geordi LaForge. \"Just change the Gravitational Constant of the Universe\". </p>\n\n\"We can't <i>do</i> that, Q\", Geordi snaps. \n\n<p>\"Oh. Well then. Nevermind.\" </p>\n\n<h2>Books</h2>\n<p>[[image:Iqnovelcover.JPG|right]]</p>\n\nQ has appeared in a number of Star Trek novels, including one written by Peter David and John deLancie, <i>I, Q</i>\n\n<h2>Related Articles</h2>\n\n*[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]\n*[[Star Trek: Voyager]]\n*[[Guinan]]\n*[[Captain Jean Luc Picard]]\n*[[Captain Janeway]]\n\n<p>[[Category:Star Trek]]</p>"

While the classy (yet now sadly dated) ''Twilight Zone'' put on reasonably intelligent short stories, episodic Science Fiction TV started out pretty abysmal. \n\n<p>Who here remembers ''It's About Time''? This half-hour sitcom featured a pair of US astronauts somehow slung back into the Stone Age, where they had to form alliance with the 'cavemen' of the period, who spoke perfect English in sentences of two words. \"Oog. Me go. You Stay.\" When this premise was seen to pall (and it palled pretty quickly, frankly), in a surprise plot twist, the astronauts returned to their own time, but look! they brought their caveman tribe with them! Hi-jinx, sadly, ensued. It was the Time Travelling Beverly Hillbillies In Space.</p>\n\n[[Star_Trek:_Original_Series_-_Best_Episode|Star Trek]] changed all that. A show for adults, with adult situations and a dramatic setting, ''Star Trek'' moved science fiction television out of the sitcom basement recroom and into the modern age.\n\n<p>It was quickly followed by other shows, such as ''The Six Million Dollar Man'' and the quirky spy-in-a-trap drama, [[The Prisoner]] that were meant to appeal to adults, or at least all ages, as opposed to just kids.</p>\n\nNow at least three or four science fiction shows debut every year, although they often quickly bow out. It has become a protective measure not to bond too soon to any particular show, since one-season sci-fi shows are the norm. Still, good sci-fi is thicker on the ground that it once was, and that's all to the good. \n\n<p>This category celebrates science fiction TV shows past and present.</p>"
